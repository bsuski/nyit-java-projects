Welcome to an array of my college projects. Please remember:

- These projects are uncut, unedited since their creation.
- Some projects lack GUIs consequently, and serve merely as an example.
- Credit is given to other authors in some of these projects such as Professor Wei, and for that reason, please do not reuse code without contacting me. 
- These files are for learning purposes. 
- These programs were created under NYIT's cirriculum.

Please email me at bsuski@nyit.edu for any comments or concerns. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Bridget
